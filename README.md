# PortfolioWebs
Created My personal portfolio website and linked all my social accounts and links 

The HTML code is a basic structure of a web page that includes a heading, a paragraph and a set of links to social media accounts. 
The CSS styles are used to set the font family, font size, text alignment, and background color of the web page. 
It also includes some animation effects like typing and blinking using the keyframes property in CSS.

The code also includes a canvas element with an ID, which is used in the JavaScript file named "main.js".
The JavaScript file defines a function that creates a parallax effect in the background of the web page by animating the canvas elements.

Overall, this is a basic example of how to structure a web page and use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create animations and effects like parallax scrolling.
